The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has ordered the city of Benton Harbor, Michigan, to take immediate actions to improve the quality of its drinking water to protect residents from lead exposure.The move from the federal agency comes about two weeks after the Benton Harbor City Commission voted to declare a state of emergency over the tainted water.The people of Benton Harbor have suffered for too long. EPA is fully engaged and working to support the community, and today, we are taking a critical next step to ensure that drinking water is safe and reliable, EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a news release Tuesday.In September, a coalition of groups filed an emergency petition to the EPA asking for federal intervention in mandating assistance in the community.Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said last month that the city's water system has failed to meet the regulatory standard for lead for six consecutive sampling periods over the last three years.Benton Harbor, which borders Lake Michigan on the western edge of the state, is roughly 85% Black and is home to nearly 10,000 people.n October, state officials recommended residents use bottled water instead of tap water for activities including cooking, drinking and brushing teeth, in what officials said was a part of a longer-term effort to eliminate exceedances of the federal lead standards, educate the community on the effects of lead in drinking water, remove lead service lines and increase confidence in filtered water from the tap.The EPA directive requires the city to take several steps to protect residents while addressing the source of the lead contamination, according to the agency's news release.Those steps include:	•	Informing residents when lead exceedances are detected in drinking water	•	Improving application of chlorine for disinfection and orthophosphate for corrosion control	•	Implementing stricter requirements for monitoring of residual disinfectants and byproducts	•	Making filter repairs at the water treatment plant	•	Using an independent third-party to evaluate alternatives for long-term operation and maintenance of the systemExposure to lead in children can cause irreversible and life-long health effects, including decreasing IQ, focus, and academic achievement, Regan said. The water infrastructure in Benton Harbor, like many cities across the country, needs upgrades and investments to build resiliency and protect people from lead.The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy is taking separate actions to address the violations of state laws, according to the EPA announcement.
